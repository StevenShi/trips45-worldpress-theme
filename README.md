trips45-worldpress-theme
========================

trips45 is a free worldpress theme.  It is based on Inkness, a responsive theme with 3-column grid based homepage layout. This theme includes a reponsive slider, multiple page layouts, configurable sidebar locations, footer widgets & easy to use admin panel. Dot pot files are provided for I18N translation into other languages.

The theme is used by [Trips For Five web site ](http://blog.trips45.com).  I created this theme because I wanted a blog site that does not look too much like other Wordpress sites -- the theme by design uses a single column style, without the widget clusters on the pages.  It also de-emphasizes social icons by having them show up in the footer area only.


I also wanted to build a site with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/gsp6ccs).  Unlike Google Font, Typekit Fonts are not free, however, you can sign up for a trial account, which does not expire as of today's writing.  By default, the site uses museo-sans and raleway fonts from Typekit.  You are welcome to change the default fonts, however, you will need to modify the code in header.php.  There is no configuration in the Admin Panel to do that.

The theme comes GNU General Public License. More details about the License can be found in the license.txt file included in the theme.
