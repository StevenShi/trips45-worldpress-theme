{"name":"Trips45-worldpress-theme","tagline":"trips45 worldpress theme","body":"trips45-worldpress-theme\r\n========================\r\n\r\ntrips45 is a free worldpress theme.  It is based on Inkness, a responsive theme with 3-column grid based homepage layout. This theme includes a reponsive slider, multiple page layouts, configurable sidebar locations, footer widgets & easy to use admin panel. Dot pot files are provided for I18N translation into other languages.\r\n\r\nThe theme is used by [Trips For Five web site ](http://blog.trips45.com).  I created this theme because I wanted a blog site to look different from many other Wordpress sites -- the theme by design uses a single column style, with a single menu navigation, and without the usual widget and sidebar clusters on Wordpress pages.  It also de-emphasizes social icons by having them show up in the footer area only.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also wanted to build a site with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/gsp6ccs).  Unlike Google Font, Typekit Fonts are not free, however, you can sign up for a trial account, which does not expire as of the time of writing.  By default, the theme uses museo-sans and raleway fonts from Typekit.  You are welcome to change the default fonts, however, you will need to modify the code in header.php if you decide to use any third party fonts.  There is no configuration in the Admin Panel to do that.\r\n\r\nThe theme comes GNU General Public License.
