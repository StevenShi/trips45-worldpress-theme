{"name":"Trips45-worldpress-theme","tagline":"trips45 worldpress theme","body":"trips45-worldpress-theme\r\n========================\r\n\r\ntrips45 worldpress theme was based on Inkness, a responsive theme with 3-column grid based homepage layout. This theme includes a reponsive slider, multiple page layouts, configurable sidebar locations, footer widgets & easy to use admin Panel. .pot file has been provided for I18N translation into other languages.\r\n\r\nThe theme is used by the[Trips For Five web site ](http://blog.trips45.com).  I created this theme because I wanted a blog site that does not look very much like a Wordpress site, so the theme by design uses a single column style, without the widget clusters at the side.  \r\n\r\nI also wanted to build a site with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/colophons/gsp6ccs).  Unlike Google Font, Typekit Fonts are not free, however, you can sign up for a trial account, which does not expire as of today's writing.\r\n\r\nYou are free to use and modify the theme.
